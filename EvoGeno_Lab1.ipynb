    "# Lab 1 : Sequences and Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "The biologist's string quartet is composed of nucleic acids.  The computer-science terminology is a little different from the biology terminology. In computer science parlance, a sequence of symbols is called a string. For instance, this sentence is a string. A language is a (finite or infinite) set of strings. You often hear bioinformaticians referring to an actual sequence of DNA or protein as a \"string,\" as opposed to its representation as sequence data. This is an example of the terminologies of the two disciplines crossing over into one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's lab we will begin working with DNA and RNA strings (sequences) and you will write programs to join exons, transcribe DNA into RNA and find codons in your mRNA. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 The Programming Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamental elements in the programming process include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Making an overall design for the program, including the general algorithm by which the program computes the output.\n",
    "* Identifying the required inputs.\n",
    "* Deciding how the outputs will print; for example, to files or displayed graphically.\n",
    "* Refining the overall design by specifying more detail.\n",
    "* Writing the Python program code.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem like writing code is the hard part, but really the design phase often is the tricky step because you need to understand what you can do with Python before you start writing.  As you learn the Python programming language some programs will become trivial while others may take hours to days to design.  Usually the best way to tackle the design is to break the program into small parts and try to connect them together.   There is actually a whole field of specialization called software engineering that addresses these issues.  The style of programming we will be using is called imperative programming that relies on dividing a problem into interacting subroutines.  A popular programming style is object-oriented programming which, as we will see later, is used in Biopython.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing in Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing in pseudocode is a lot like scribbling ideas down on a napkin.  If I wanted to find all heme motifs in a genome I might begin by writing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get sequence from GenBank.  \n",
    "* Extract the coding sequences.\n",
    "* Find heme motifs in coding sequence.\n",
    "* Save proteins with heme motifs to a file\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you begin writing code to accomplish these tasks.  Often as you work on one task you may find that it needs to be broken down into even smaller parts.  This modular approach to programming is also very useful for finding errors in the smaller parts of your program before you stick them together into a complete program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the pseudocode is integrated into the program using comments.  Comments are all lines beginning with # and are ignored by the Python interpreter (except the first line of your program as you will see below).  They are extremely useful in understanding what a program does.  Comments can make your program intelligible by others, but more importantly they will help you understand what you did when you revise the program a month later.  You can also use the # sign to \"comment out\" portions of your code when you are testing and debugging the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing TextWrangler Preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very helpful for interpreting error messages to see the line number in your program.   To do this in TextWrangler in the menu bar go to TextWrangler-> Preferences -> Text Status Display.  Click on \"Show line numbers\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If the small type drives you nuts or if you want me to be able to read your code you can make the font bigger by going to TextWrangler-> Preferences -> Editor Defaults.  I recommend 12pt font or greater.  \n"

    "\n",
    "The data stored in computer memory can be of many types. For example, a person's telephone number is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is stored as alphanumeric characters. Python has five standard data types that are used to define the operations possible on them and the storage method for each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numbers - Number data types store numeric values. \n",
    "* Strings - A string is any piece of text, whether it a single character or a complete genome. Because of the many ways that Python provides for working with strings, it is an great language for text processing and bioinformatic applications.\n",
    "* Lists - A list stores a group of items one after the other, just like a grocery list or a list of gene names. It keeps them in order for you. You can add or remove items, sort your list or search through it to see if it contains a specific item.\n",
    "* Tuples - Tuples are a lot like lists in that they are used to store sequences of information, but they can't be altered after they have been created.  In some cases tuples are more computational efficienct over working with lists.\n",
    "* Dictionaries - Dictionaries store values with keys, so you can look them up with the key. You can use them to build complex nested data-structures or just for storing values. The values can be numbers, strings, lists, tuples and even other dictionaries.\n",

When a script with a shebang is run as a program, the program loader parses the rest of the script's initial line as an interpreter directive; the specified interpreter program is run instead, which in our example is Python.

The other name makes it unclear what the program is doing or what the variable is for. Using well-chosen names is part of what's called self-documenting code.

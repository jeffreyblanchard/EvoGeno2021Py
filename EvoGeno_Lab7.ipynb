    "# Lab 7: git and GitHub\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Acknowledgements\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the material for this lesson was borrowed from or inspired by Matt Jones' NCEAS Reproducible Research Techniques for Synthesis workshop](https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2020-02-RRCourse/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What computational reproducibility is and why it is useful\n",
    "- How version control can increase computational reproducibility\n",
    "- to set up git on your computer\n",
    "- to use git and github to track changes to your work over time\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reproducible Research\n",
    "\n",
    "Reproducibility is the hallmark of science, which is based on empirical observations \n",
    "coupled with explanatory models.  While reproducibility encompasses \n",
    "the full science lifecycle, and includes issues such as methodological consistency and\n",
    "treatment of bias, in this course we will focus on **computational reproducibility**: \n",
    "the ability to document data, analyses, and models sufficiently for other researchers \n",
    "to be able to understand and ideally re-execute the computations that led to \n",
    "scientific results and conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is needed for computational reproducibility?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step towards addressing these issues is to be able to evaluate the data,\n",
    "analyses, and models on which conclusions are drawn.  Under current practice, \n",
    "this can be difficult because data are typically unavailable, the method sections\n",
    "of papers do not detail the computational approaches used, and analyses and models\n",
    "are often conducted in graphical programs, or, when scripted analyses are employed,\n",
    "the code is not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yet, this is easily remedied.  Researchers can achieve computational \n",
    "reproducibility through open science approaches, including straightforward steps \n",
    "for archiving data and code openly along with the scientific workflows describing \n",
    "the provenance of scientific results (e.g., @hampton_tao_2015, @munafo_manifesto_2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptualizing workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific workflows encapsulate all of the steps from data acquisition, cleaning,\n",
    "transformation, integration, analysis, and visualization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/workflow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflows can range in detail from simple flowcharts \n",
    "to fully executable scripts. R scripts and python scripts are a textual form \n",
    "of a workflow, and when researchers publish specific versions of the scripts and \n",
    "data used in an analysis, it becomes far easier to repeat their computations and \n",
    "understand the provenance of their conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The problem with filenames\n",
    "\n",
    "Every file in the scientific process changes.  Manuscripts are edited.\n",
    "Figures get revised.  Code gets fixed when problems are discovered.  Data files\n",
    "get combined together, then errors are fixed, and then they are split and \n",
    "combined again. In the course of a single analysis, one can expect thousands of\n",
    "changes to files.  And yet, all we use to track this are simplistic *filenames*.  \n",
    "You might think there is a better way, and you'd be right: __version control__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control systems help you track all of the changes to your files, without\n",
    "the spaghetti mess that ensues from simple file renaming.  In version control systems\n",
    "like `git`, the system tracks not just the name of the file, but also its contents,\n",
    "so that when contents change, it can tell you which pieces went where.  It tracks\n",
    "which version of a file a new version came from.  So its easy to draw a graph\n",
    "showing all of the versions of a file, like this one:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/version-graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control systems assign an identifier to every version of every file, and \n",
    "track their relationships. They also allow branches in those versions, and merging\n",
    "those branches back into the main line of work.  They also support having \n",
    "*multiple copies* on multiple computers for backup, and for collaboration.\n",
    "And finally, they let you tag particular versions, such that it is easy to return \n",
    "to a set of files exactly as they were when you tagged them.  For example, the \n",
    "exact versions of data, code, and narrative that were used when a manuscript was originally \n",
    "submitted might be `eco-ms-1` in the graph above, and then when it was revised and resubmitted,\n",
    "it was done with tag `eco-ms-2`.  A different paper was started and submitted with tag `dens-ms-1`, showing that you can be working on multiple manuscripts with closely related but not identical sets of code and data being used for each, and keep track of it all.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Version control and Collaboration using Git and GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "First, just what are `git` and GitHub?\n",
    "\n",
    "- __git__: version control software used to track files in a folder (a repository)\n",
    "    - git creates the versioned history of a repository\n",
    "- __GitHub__: web site that allows users to store their git repositories and share them with others\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting started on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to https://github.com/ and sign up for an account. This is a good opportunity to create a professional presence in the bioinformatics and data science world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a personal access token \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting this fall GitHub is requiring personal access tokens. To generate one follow https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token This will serve as your password later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cloning a repository\n",
    "\n",
    "You can clone any Github repository. This is the whole purpose, to openly share code. To do this you must install git on your computer.  Fortunately for us git is already\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by cloning the course repository - https://github.com/jeffreyblanchard/EvoGeno2021PyTo do so, locate the green \"CODE\" button and copy the URL. Now go to RStudio Cloud or Unity and open a terminal. Type\n"

This keeps the high level details readable in the version log.  I can't count the number of times I've looked at the commit log from 2, 3, or 10 years prior and been so grateful for diligence of my past self and collaborators."
